TITLE: Compass Read and Publish


GOAL:

- Read HMC5883L compass sensor with Atmega328P over I2C. 
	+ read x axis magnitude in gauss
	+ read y axis magnitude in gauss
	+ read z axis magnitude in gauss
	+ calculate total magnitude using pythagoean theorem in R3. 
- Send data to ESP8266 over UART. 
- Publish data 	

DELIVERABLES: 

The final deliverable is a device that will capture magnetic 
field data and publish it to a webserver for viewing on a website.
